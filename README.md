#Brief Description
Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the state of the atmosphere for a given location. Human beings have attempted to predict the weather informally for millennium and formally since the nineteenth century. Weather forecasts are made by collecting quantitative data about the current state of the atmosphere on a given place and using scientific understanding of atmospheric processes to project how the atmosphere will evolve on that place. Using Internet of Things (IOT), we can control any electronic equipment in homes and industries. Moreover, you can read a data from any sensor and analyse it graphically from anywhere in the world. Here, we can read temperature and humidity data from DHT11 sensor and upload it to a ThingSpeak cloud using Arduino Uno and ESP8266-02 module. Arduino Uno is MCU, it fetch a data of humidity and temperature from DHT11 sensor and Process it and give it to a ESP8266 Module.ESP8266 is a WiFi module, it is one of the leading platform for Internet of Things. It can transfer a data to IOT cloud.
